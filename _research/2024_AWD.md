**Dates**: 2024--2026

As of January 2024, I am involved in the InterReg Atlantic Area project ["Atlantic Whale Deal: Mitigating Ship Strikes and Enhancing Carbon Sequestration in the Atlantic"](https://www.atlanticarea.eu/discover-our-projects/approved-projects/atlantic-whale-deal), co-leading the Work PAckage "Risk Maps and Acoustic Contamination Assessment", where we will map the collision risk over the north-east Atlantic area based on whales' favorable habitats and shiping lanes. The WP will also involve a direct modelling of the collision probability as to better understand the process and predict the effectiveness of various mitigation measures (*e.g.* reducing ship speed).
