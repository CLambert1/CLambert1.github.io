I join the CEBC lab within the framework of the EU-funded EcoScope project ("ecocentric management for sustainable fisheries and healthy ecosystems", www.ecoscopium.eu), with the objective of determining energy scapes of marine megafauna throughout the year. Energy scapes represent variations in energetics needs of an organism through geographical space depending on occurring environmental conditions. With these estimated energy scapes, and building from knowledge of diet composition and body mass distributions in population, we will estimate the total biomass of foraged species consummed by the marine megafauna community within the Mediterranean Sea, in summer. This work is focused on a wide panel of species (cetaceans, seabirds, sea turtles, tunas, sharks, rays, swordfish) and will combine data of very different nature within a consistent statistical framework.
