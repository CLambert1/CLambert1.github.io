I am a marine ecologist at La Rochelle University (France) interested in processes determining species distributions, and mechanisms driving their variations. In particular, I look to understand how the ecological niche of marine species change over seasons and years, and how these changes impact geographical distribution of individuals. As to understand the reasons behind those changes, I integrate functional and energetics aspects into ecological niche modelling. 

I work on numerous species, especially seabirds and cetaceans, within various marine regions (Mediterranean, Eastern North Atlantic, Indian Ocean, Central South Pacific and global scale), and apply several species distribution modelling methods within R to different type of data (visual censuses (boat- and plane-based); tracking data). My work also helped evaluate and inform marine spatial planning in the French waters. 

Currently, I work with Dr David Gr√©millet within the framework of the EU-funded EcoScope project ("ecocentric management for sustainable fisheries and healthy ecosystems", www.ecoscopium.eu), with the objective of determining energy scapes of marine megafauna throughout the year.
