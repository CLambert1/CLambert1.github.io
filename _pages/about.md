I am a marine ecologist at the French Center for Scientific Research (CNRS), based in La Rochelle (LIENSs), interested in processes determining species distributions, and mechanisms driving their variations. In particular, I seek to understand how the ecological niche of marine species changes over seasons and years, and how these changes impact the geographical distribution of individuals. As to understand the reasons behind those changes, I integrate functional and energetic aspects into ecological niche modelling. 

I work on numerous species, especially seabirds and cetaceans, within various marine regions (Mediterranean, Eastern North Atlantic, Indian Ocean, Central South Pacific and global scale), and apply several species distribution modelling methods within R to different types of data (boat- and plane-based visual censuses; tracking data). My work helped evaluate and inform marine spatial planning in French waters and was used for the Mediterranean Quality Status Report (2023) by the United Nations Environment Programme - Mediterranean Action Plan (Marine Litter Ecological Objective). 

Navigating the tabs above, you can find my complete [publication](publications.md) list, the [talks and posters](conferences.md) presented in international conferences, the details of past and current [research projects](research.html) and the list of [R packages and data repositories](codes.md) I authored.
