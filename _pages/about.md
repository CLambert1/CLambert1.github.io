Understanding the drivers of species distributions through space and time

I am a marine ecologist at the French Center for Scientific Research (CNRS), based in La Rochelle ([LIENSs lab](https://lienss.univ-larochelle.fr/)), interested in processes determining species distributions, and mechanisms driving their variations. In particular, I seek to understand how the ecological niche of marine species changes over seasons and years, and how these changes impact the geographical distribution of individuals. As to understand the reasons behind those changes, I integrate functional and energetic aspects into ecological niche modelling. I currently co-lead the WP2 of the InterReg Atlantic Area project "Atlantic Whale Deal", aiming to map the collision risk between whales and cargo ships throughout the north-eastern Atlantic. 

I work on numerous marine species, especially megafauna like seabirds and cetaceans, within various marine regions (Mediterranean, Eastern North Atlantic, Indian Ocean, Central South Pacific and global scale), and apply several species distribution modelling methods within R to different types of data (boat- and plane-based visual censuses; tracking data). My work helped evaluate and inform marine spatial planning in French waters and was used for the Mediterranean Quality Status Report (2023) by the United Nations Environment Programme - Mediterranean Action Plan (Marine Litter Ecological Objective). My interests also include simulation frameworks, mecanistic SDMs, and Individual Based Modelling. Although my current research focuses on seabords and cetaceans, I am also interested in fish (especially large predatory species and sunfish) and invertebrates (especially cephalopods). 

Navigating the tabs above, you can find my complete [publication](publications.md) list, the [talks and posters](conferences.md) presented in international conferences, the details of past and current [research projects](research.html) and the list of [R packages and data repositories](codes.md) I authored.

**Join the group**

I currently have no offer opened, but feel free to contact me for potential collaborations if you ambition to build doctoral or post-doctoral research projects focused on species distribution, niche dynamics, how these may be affected by anthropogenic threats, today, in the past or in the future, either using population (large-scale survey) or individual (tagging) points of view, either based on real or simulated marine ecosystems.
