I authored various R packages either on [GitHub](https://github.com/CLambert1]) or GitLab, and more specifically in the [marine spatial ecoloy group from La Rochelle Universit√©](https://gitlab.univ-lr.fr/marine_spatial_ecology/nichedynamics). I also list here the various repositories created to store paper-associated R codes and data.
